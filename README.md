As a highly skilled Gameplay Engineer with expertise in C++ and Unreal Engine, I have over 5 years of experience programming game mechanics and systems for multiple platforms. My passion for the video game industry and emerging technologies drives me to continuously innovate within my field.

Prior to my work as a Gameplay Engineer, I spent over 5 years as a university instructor teaching game development to students at various levels. I also have experience as a researcher, having published a research paper on virtual reality and augmented reality design.
