I am a Gameplay Engineer, experienced with C++ and Unreal Engine.

I have over 5 years of experience programming game mechanics and systems for PC, console, virtual-reality, augmented-reality and mobile applications.

I have an inherent passion for the video game industry and emerging technologies, and continually seek to innovate within my field.

I previously taught game development to university students for over 5 years and published a research paper on virtual-reality and augmented-reality design.
