As a highly skilled Gameplay Engineer with expertise in C++ and Unreal Engine, I have over 5 years of experience programming game mechanics and systems for multiple platforms. My passion for the video game industry and emerging technologies drives me to continuously innovate within my field.

I leverage my strong background in education to bridge the gap between industry and academia. With over 5 years of experience as a university instructor teaching game development to students at various levels, I understand the intricacies of educational programs and how they intersect with industry needs. Additionally, my time as a researcher, during which I published a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NetTc0TOJvVVAdKwaV0vyUW4cl910AUz/view?usp=sharing">research paper</a> on virtual reality and augmented reality design, has provided me with a deep understanding of cutting-edge technologies and their applications in both education and industry.

With this unique blend of experience in game development, education, and research, I bring a holistic perspective to my work. I am adept at creating engaging and innovative gameplay experiences while also considering the educational requirements and learning outcomes of the field. I am excited to apply my skills and expertise to new challenges, and I am eager to contribute to a team of passionate professionals in the video game industry.
